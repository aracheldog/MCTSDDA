# MCTSDDA
 DDA algorithm for a two-player real-time fighting game.

I use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm  to train a DDA agent with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to enable the DDA agent to adjust game difficulty according to the performance of the opponents' gaming ability in a real-time manner.
